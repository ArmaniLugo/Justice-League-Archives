                Earth), taking the alias Wonder Woman. There, Diana and Trevor fell in love as they fought side-by-side
                in World War II for the Allies. Despite this, however, Diana became traumatized by the capacity for evil
                that man as a gender was capable of.

                ever been before. Her first appearance was in the injustice gods among us the video game by netherrealm
